## 👋 Hi, I’m Ousman Bah  
### Junior Computer Science Student at FIU  
### Focused on AI, software engineering, and building tools for real-world impact

I’m a Computer Science student at Florida International University (FIU) who enjoys building meaningful projects and learning advanced AI concepts. I’ve gained hands-on experience through the Google Tech Exchange Program and the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship at Cornell Tech. I also work on full-stack applications, AI tools, and mobile apps, and I enjoy mentoring others through competitive programming.

I’m always looking to grow, collaborate, and connect with peers and professionals in the tech community.
